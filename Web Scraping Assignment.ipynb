    "\n",
    "4. XPath: XPath is a query language used to navigate and extract data from XML or HTML documents. It provides a way to define paths to elements based on their position, attributes, or text content. XPath can be used with libraries like lxml (Python) to scrape specific data from web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. CSS Selectors: CSS selectors are another method to locate and extract data from HTML documents. They allow you to target elements based on their class, ID, tag name, or hierarchical relationship with other elements. Libraries like BeautifulSoup (Python) and Jsoup (Java) support CSS selectors for web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Web Scraping Frameworks: There are several web scraping frameworks and libraries that provide higher-level abstractions and features for scraping tasks. Scrapy (Python) and Puppeteer (JavaScript) are popular examples that offer built-in functionalities for handling requests, managing sessions, and handling complex scraping scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Headless Browsers: Headless browsers, such as Puppeteer (JavaScript) and Selenium (multiple languages), simulate web browsers without a graphical user interface. They allow interaction with JavaScript-rendered websites, dynamic content, and handling of AJAX requests, making them suitable for scraping websites with complex front-end interactivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. API-Based Scraping: Some websites offer APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that provide structured access to their data. Instead of scraping the website directly, you can use the provided API endpoints to retrieve the desired data in a more efficient and reliable manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that while web scraping methods can be powerful, it is important to be aware of legal and ethical considerations, respect website terms of service, and avoid overloading servers with excessive requests, as per the website's guidelines.\n",
